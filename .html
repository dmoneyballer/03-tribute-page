I decided to make a tribute page to honor my maternal
grandmother,Laree Israelsen.  Without her contributions, I would not be here and to her I'm
 truely grateful.  My grandma was born in 1938 in Afton Wyoming.  She has a twin
  sister named Larue and they used to sing duets, it was their cooperative talent.
  She loved living on a ranch in Wyoming.  She especially enjoyed riding their
   horse, Pet. She liked milking the cows but she didn't like slopping the pigs
   and collecting eggs.  When she was 17, she was coaxed into trying out to be
   Bear Lake County queen.  She rode her neighbor's horse named Skippy and she
   ended up with a broken finger, not the crown.  The summer before she left for
   college, her dad and a family friend started a cafe to help pay for a college
   education for the twins.  They worked there and during that summer, her dad
    had a heart attack and died.  She moved to Logan and went to school.  She
    met my grandfather in March of 1959.  They went on their first date on April
    9, 1959 and hit it off.  They eventually got married in July of 1959, that's
    seems like a short courtship to me but it really worked for them.  My
    grandfather got a civil engineering degree and worked on two dams while my
    grandma got a teaching degree and raised their first sontaught school.
    Then they moved to Texas     because grandpa had graduated from the ROTC and
     needed to do officer training school.  In Texas my mother was born, they
     were there for a little over a year then they got to move back to Utah
     because the Bay of Pigs invasion got called off.  They kept having kids,
     and my grandpa got a masters degree in civil engineering and worked at the
     water lab at Utah State University.  He published papers and due to that, my grandparents
     traveled a little so he could talk about his work.  he worked at Utah State University for 17 years or so and
     retired to work for Hyrum city although he still kept working at the water
     lab part time.  Through all this my grandma was able to raise 7 kids and
     help her kids raise their grandchildren.  For example, I'm a triplet and
     when we were born, my grandma came Sunday through Friday to help my mom
     with all of us.  In 2001, She started feeling bad and felt that she was
     anemic.  The doctors didn't find anything till 2002 when they diagnosed her
     with colon cancer.  She was operated on and went through chemotherapy.  She
     fought the cancer for a long time even though it progressed quickly to stage
     4.  She passed away in 2007.
     <hr>
     Her memory lives on though, it lives on
     through the kindness she so freely shared with those who crossed her path.
     I find her life quite amazing.  Although most of my memories of her were while she had cancer, she always had a smile on her face
   and wanted to talk to me about my life.   She loved to give hugs to all that would recieve them.  I really hope that I can reflect
 the love that I saw her show.  </div></body>
